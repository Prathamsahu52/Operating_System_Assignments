I have read the CSE departmentâ€™s anti-cheating policy available at https://www.cse.
iitk.ac.in/pages/AntiCheatingPolicy.html. I understand that plagiarism is a severe
offense. I have solved this assignment myself without indulging in any plagiarism.
If my submission is found to be plagiarized from the internet, fellow students, etc.,
then strict action can be taken against me. Pratham Sahu 210755

The resources I have referred to while solving the assignment are:

- Linux man pages: https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/
- Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau. Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces.(OSTEP)
- M. J. Bach. Design of the Unix Operating System, Prentice Hall of India, 1986.
- Class slides
